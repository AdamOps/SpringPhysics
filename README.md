# SpringPhysics
Simulation of blob physics

Using mass spring systems to generate soft-body properties

Main features:
  - Spring system
  - Verlet integration behind movement (for stability)
  - Iterative updating to ensure shape stability
  - Example structure of how to model round and box-shaped soft bodies
  
To do:
  - Let the user define points during run-time, connect these points and generate a stable blob (regardless of convexity/concavity).
